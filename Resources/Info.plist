INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:

To add these permissions to your Xcode project:

Method 1: Using Xcode's Info Tab
1. Select your project in the navigator
2. Select the Trek target
3. Go to the "Info" tab
4. Click the "+" button to add new keys
5. Add each key with its corresponding string value

Method 2: Using Property List File
1. If you have an Info.plist file in your project
2. Open it as source code (right-click → Open As → Source Code)
3. Copy the relevant keys from above into your plist's <dict> section

Method 3: Using Xcode's Capabilities
For UIBackgroundModes:
1. Select your project in the navigator
2. Select the Trek target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Click "+ Capability"
5. Add "Background Modes"
6. Check "Location updates"

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- These permission descriptions will be shown to users when requesting access
- Be clear and specific about why you need each permission
- Apple reviews these descriptions during app review
- Generic or unclear descriptions may lead to app rejection
- Only request permissions that you actually use in your app
- Consider the user's privacy and only collect necessary data

TESTING PERMISSIONS:

During development:
1. Run the app on a device or simulator
2. When prompted, grant location permissions
3. To reset permissions: Settings → General → Reset → Reset Location & Privacy
4. Or Settings → [Your App] → Location → Select permission level

For background tracking:
1. Grant "Always" permission
2. Start an activity
3. Put the app in background or lock the device
4. The app should continue tracking (check logs)
5. Monitor battery usage during testing

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS:

- Always explain to users why background location is needed
- Provide in-app settings to limit background tracking
- Show location permission prompts at appropriate times (not on first launch)
- Be transparent about data collection and usage
- Implement opt-out mechanisms for background tracking
- Monitor and optimize battery usage
